Planning, analysis and organization of production processes are words that acquired a new meaning at that time. During two years of work, I had the opportunity to get to know the realities of working in the production area and learn not only how to manage this area, but also the art of diplomacy :).',

Analysing reports from aviation services and predicting failure of individual parts of aircraft engines and the cost of their repair has become my second life.

Learning there was based on practice (more practise, less theory) to know the most popular software languages and learn the best web development practise while working on the new projects. During 10 months of study, I wrote two individual projects and many projects under the guidance of a mentor. I also participated and finished with succes a group project in which a group of 7 people worked on the website of a furniture store for three weeks. Under the mentors supervision, the code was reviewed and finaly approved. ',
